All setting are defualt just make sure you set it up to run at start up threw tash scheduler

# Cursor
A simple [circle cursor](https://www.deviantart.com/idarques/art/Point-er-900139915), I think it fits better with the theme then a sharp cursor style.

# Wallpaper
I am very picky with wallpapers as I want them to look good for both single monitor and multi monitor use. I have 5 wallpaper options and some work well for multi but not all.
